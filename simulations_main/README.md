# Simulation study in main manuscript

The main manuscript evaluates the proposed estimators in a brief set of
numerical experiments detailed in Section S5. The results presented establish
the desirable performance of our IPW estimators in observational studies with
and without a treatment effect. `Rcode_Biometrics1.R`, the singular R script
contained in this directory can be used to reproduce the results of these two
experiments.
