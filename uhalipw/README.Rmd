## What's `uhalipw`?

The `uhalipw` R package...

---

## Installation

Install the _most recent version_ from the `master` branch on GitHub via
[`remotes`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("nhejazi/uhalipw")
```

Eventually, the package may make its way to [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org).
At that point, a stable version may be installed via

```{r cran-stable-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("uhalipw")
```
